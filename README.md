## Information for Contributors

### How to add a Real World App

Given a GitHub repo for an app `githubuser/foo`:

```bash
# Inside the project root:
git submodule add -b master git@github.com:githubuser/foo.git apps/foo
```

### Updating the apps submodules to latest

The apps in `apps/` are git submodules. Git submodules are locked to a revision and don't stay in sync with the latest revision.

To update the revisions, run:

```bash
# This will take some time:
git submodule foreach git pull origin master
```
